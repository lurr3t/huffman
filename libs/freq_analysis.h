 * @brief A datatype responsible for doing a frequency analysis on bytes from an input file.
 *
 * According to which option has been chosen different things will happen.
 *
 * -encode : The bytes from the input file will be counted and put into a table. The analysis will also
 * be stored in a separate file.
 *
 * -decode : The analysis that is stored in a file will be loaded to the frequency table.
